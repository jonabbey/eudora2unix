"""
For interpreting Eudora mailbox '.toc' files.

Structure elements are read as characters because integers are all
big-endian (like the Mac), and I want this to run on little-ending
machines (like the IBM PC).

This code could be much improved by making use of Python's built-
in endian struct declarations

Note that some Mac versions keep the toc info in the resource forks
of the mailbox files.  This info has to be put in a toc file before
this script can work.  A utilitiy for doing this is available at
<ftp://ftp.eudora.com/eudora/eudoralight/mac/extras/utils/TOCConvert.sea.hqx>

For Windows Eudora TOC file format, see
http://wso.williams.edu/~eudora/kens/toc.html
Note the Mac and Windows formats are quite different

See RFC 2076 for a discussion of Status header

	This version number seems to be made to look good in hex, but not
	doesn't really mean much as an integer.   For example,
	Mac Eudora Lite 3.x has version 0001, Windows Eudora Pro 5.o has 0030
	As a guess, if the upper byte is nonzero, it's Windows, otherwise,
	it's Mac.

        From prior list:
        Eudora toc file versions I've seen:
        MAC_EUDORA_LITE_3 = 0x0001
        MAC_EUDORA_LITE_131 = 0x0000 # (a Poor choice!)

        WIN_EUDORA_5 = 0x0300
        Windows 6.1.0.6 used 0x0000 also. It's possible that no file format identifier shows Mac vs Windows?

        Note that Windows Eudora 6.1.0.6 invalidates all this theory, so we rely on the passed-in isMac variable instead.
